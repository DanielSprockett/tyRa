`tyRa` is an R package that I created to facilitate building models from 16S rRNA amplicon data stored in `phyloseq` objects. 

## Load Pacakages

Load Packages.

```{r load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

require("ggplot2")
require("phyloseq")
require("minpack.lm")
require("Hmisc")
require("stats4")
require("tyRa")

```

## Import

Import the phyloseq object. We'll just take the samples from healthy individuals  for this demonstration. We'll also filter down to only very prevalent taxa. 

```{r import data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ps <- readRDS("/Users/daniel/R_packages/tyRa/data/infants_ps.rds")
ps

```

This dataset is a subset of gut microbiome profiles generated from European infants. It had already been rarefied to 10,000 sequences per sample. 

# Fit Model

Currently, there is only model available, but I'll be adding more over time. We'll fit this dataset with the Sloan (2006) Neutral Community Model from [Burns et al. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2015142).

```{r fit model}

spp.out <- tyRa::fit_sncm(spp = otu_table(ps)@.Data, pool=NULL, taxon=data.frame(tax_table(ps)))

```

# Plot

Now we'll plot the output.

```{r sncm plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

plot_sncm_fit(spp.out, fill = NULL, title = "Model Fit")

```

As you can see from this plot, nearly 80% of the ASVs in this dataset fit the neutral model. 

This is a work in progress, so please let me know if you run into any problems. Thank you!
